# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This is an online study guide for the "prework" section of the UCF Coding Bootcamp. It consists of of a singular HTML file, CSS file, and JS script, and contains notes from the lessons from the prework.

This largely served as a guide to understanding how these different files interact with one another and provide an experience to the user. It also served as a valuable exposure to proper usage of Git, in which originally I was unfamiliar with important concepts such as creating and merging branches.

I've had exposure to HTML, JS, and CSS exposure in the past, albeit briefly, in a summer Internet Programming class. This served as a welcome refresher to writing in these langauges and creating a web page. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

While this README is short, I decided to keep the TOC so I could have a reference of a README TOC.
