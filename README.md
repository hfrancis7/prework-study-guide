# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This is an online study guide for the "prework" section of the UCF Coding Bootcamp. It consists of of a singular HTML file, CSS file, and JS script, and contains notes from the lessons from the prework.

This largely served as a guide to understanding how these different files interact with one another and provide an experience to the user. It also served as a valuable exposure to proper usage of Git, in which originally I was unfamiliar with important concepts such as creating and merging branches.

I've had exposure to HTML, JS, and CSS exposure in the past, albeit briefly, in a summer Internet Programming class. This served as a welcome refresher to writing in these langauges and creating a web page. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

While this README is short, I decided to keep the TOC so I could have a reference of a README TOC.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
